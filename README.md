# TS3Room
A simple interface to create TS3Rooms

TS3Room was born from the need to provide a simple and reliable way for users of a TeamSpeak 3 server create new channels and groups freely.
Developped with the powerfull ts3admin.class, TS3Room will allow users to:
- Create a main channel with has many channels has the TS3Room admin allows to.
- Create a server group for the main channel, allowing users to access the channels.
- Manage channel permissions.
- Manage user's permissions.

Because of the calls to the teamspeak are desynchronus, a MySQL database is needed for the interface to work.
Several checks can be activated in order to allow users to register (like by example the need to be a client from the teamspeak server for 1 day before being able to register).
Support with JTS3ServerMod is forseen.
